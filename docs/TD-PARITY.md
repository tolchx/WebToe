# TD parity charter — the full evolution map

*What "self-evolving fully toward TouchDesigner" means for WebToe, measured. Sources: the official operator categories on [docs.derivative.ca](https://docs.derivative.ca/Main_Page) (crawled 2026-06-11), the verified research in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md)/[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and the 60-project/28,698-node production corpus. This page is the standing checklist; [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) holds the phase order and measured results.*

## Scope philosophy

A browser engine can reach **creative-semantics parity** — networks, cooking, operators, expressions, rendering, interaction — but not native-device parity. Every official operator falls into one of three classes:

- **Portable** — pure compute/render semantics (most TOPs/CHOPs/SOPs/POPs/MATs): implementable as-is.
- **Web-equivalent** — device/IO ops with a browser counterpart: Video Device In → getUserMedia ✅, MIDI In → WebMIDI, OSC/TCP/UDP → WebSocket bridges, Audio Device In/Out → WebAudio, Screen Grab → getDisplayMedia, Web Render → iframe texture.
- **Native-only** — declared out of scope honestly: NDI/Spout/Syphon, DirectX/SDI/ST2110, vendor SDKs (Kinect/ZED/Oculus/NVIDIA-specific), CPlusPlus ops, Notch/Substance hosts.

## Operator inventory vs official TouchDesigner (2026 docs)

| Family | Official ops | WebToe today | Corpus-relevant¹ | Parity tier targets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TOP | ~147 | **24** | ~45 | T1: lookup, slope, luma blur/level, threshold, chroma/rgb key, cache(+select), circle, text, layout, tile, crop, resolution, remap, mirror, add/sub/mult/over/under (combine aliases), CHOP-to, normal map · T2: convolve, emboss, difference, function, SSAO-lite, render pass/select (with R3) · web-equiv: screen grab, web render |
| CHOP | 172 | **13** | ~40 | T1: trail, null, filter, resample (needs multi-sample), pattern, timer, count, trigger, logic, hold, delay, rename, shuffle, expression, keyboard in, constant-pulse · T2: audio file/device/spectrum/filter (WebAudio bundle), envelope, slope, spring, wave, beat, clock, timecode · web-equiv: MIDI in (WebMIDI), OSC in (WS bridge), panel |
| SOP | 115 | **0** | ~20 | R3 set: line, circle, rectangle, grid, sphere, box, tube, torus, merge, transform, copy, skin, add, point, noise, facet, convert, resample, switch, null/in/out · then text, sweep, revolve, twist, lattice |
| MAT | 13 | **0** | 6 | R3: constant, line, point sprite, wireframe, phong-lite → pbr-lite; later GLSL MAT |
| COMP | 45 | **1** | ~12 | R3: geometry, camera, light, ambient light, null(3D) · R6: replicator, table-driven select · R7: button, slider, container-panels, list · later: animation (keyframes), engine?, window=perform view |
| DAT | 77 | **7** | ~15 | T1: merge, transpose, sort, evaluate-lite (expressions, no Python), reorder, insert, substitute, JSON, folder?, info · web-equiv: web client (fetch), websocket, web server (within page), keyboard in · Python-execute family stays inert by policy |
| POP | 106 | **0** | ~30 | R5 on WebGPU compute: point generator, primitive, sphere/box/line/grid/circle, noise, math/math-mix/math-combine, attribute(+combine/convert), transform, copy, merge, delete, select, lookup texture/channel/attribute, normal, random, pattern, sort, sprinkle, feedback, ray, proximity, trail, in/out/null/switch/cache |

¹ types observed in the production corpus (60 projects) plus their direct dependencies.

## Engine-concept gaps (the architecture work between op counts)

| Concept | TD semantics | WebToe status → plan |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-sample CHOPs + time slicing** | channels are sample arrays over time; time-sliced cooking guarantees gapless control/audio data between frames | single-sample control rate today; ChannelSet already carries `length/rate` — introduce sliced cooking + per-op sample semantics before audio/trail/resample/wave (prereq for the CHOP T1 tier) |
| **Audio pipeline** | audio-rate CHOPs, device IO, spectrum, VST | WebAudio backend: AudioWorklet bridge ↔ multi-sample CHOPs; spectrum via AnalyserNode; file in via decodeAudioData (PLAN §5 wasm gate applies to DSP kernels) |
| **3D render pipeline** | geo/cam/light COMPs, SOP geometry, MATs, Render TOP, instancing | R3 (researched, specced in ROADMAP): typed-array geometry + minimal forward renderer on the pass contract; instancing required by corpus (115 instanced geos) |
| **GLSL TOP** | headerless desktop GLSL 4.60 with injected contract | R4 — full injected-contract table verified and documented in ROADMAP §R4 |
| **POPs** | GPU particle/point compute family | R5 — compute pass type on the WebGPU backend (the reason the dual-backend exists) |
| **Parameter system depth** | pulse params, binding/export (CHOP→par links), sequential (multi-block) params, custom pages on COMPs | pages ✅ · pulse: add `'pulse'` param type with cook-side event flag · binding: expressions cover reads; add a bind UI affordance · custom COMP pars (`.cparm` import) unlocks control panels |
| **Panels/Widgets** | UI COMPs rendered as control surfaces; `panel.*` expression values | R7: button/slider/container-panel rendering into DOM overlay; `panel` scope in expressions |
| **Perform mode** | windowed presentation of an output COMP | cheap on the web: a `?perform` route that fullscreens the display node viewer — schedule with R7 |
| **Timeline & keyframes** | global timeline, Animation COMP | engine `time` already centralized; add transport UI (play/pause/rate/loop range) then an animation COMP with keyframe channels (multi-sample prereq) |
| **Python** | scripting everywhere | permanent boundary: imported Python stays inert; the road is a sandboxed **JS callback DAT** with a TD-shaped API (`onValueChange(par)` etc.) — opt-in, never auto-running imported code |
| **Palette** | curated reusable .tox library | WebToe equivalent: example/component gallery of `.webtoe.json` comps once COMP custom pars land |
| **Locked media / .tox** | embedded binary payloads, component files | importer: parse locked TOP payloads if format proves readable; `.tox` = same expansion pipeline (toeexpand handles it already) |

## The standing self-evolution loop

1. **Measure** — run the corpus analyzer (private lab tooling) → coverage % + stub histograms; import any new real project and read its report.
2. **Pick** — highest projects-affected × lowest effort from the tier tables above; respect phase prerequisites (multi-sample before audio; R3 before render-dependent TOPs).
3. **Implement** — ops register via the public API; shaders in both backend languages; importer TYPE/PARAM tables extended; honest stubs for everything else.
4. **Verify** — unit tests + fixture round-trip + real-sketch imports in the browser; per-feature regression tests for every bug a real project exposes (two found so far: composite layer order, quoted string constants).
5. **Record** — ROADMAP measured-results line + WORKLOG entry; re-run step 1. Coverage so far: 32.3% → **47.1%** after cycle 1.

Current standing order of the big rocks: **R3 (3D) → CHOP multi-sample+T1 → R4 (GLSL) → R5 (POPs) → R6/R7 (data/panels)** — full reasoning and measured gates in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
